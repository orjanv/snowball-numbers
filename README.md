## Finding Snowball Numbers with Python

Inspired by an article at futilitycloset.com (http://www.futilitycloset.com/2014/12/28/snowball-numbers), I wrote a python program to look for such numbers. 

Basically, it takes a number and translates it into its english name and look for letter counts that ends up as a rolling snowball (ie. each letter counts increment by 1)

When such a number is found (this might take a while for two reasons, the program is far from optimized for speed and we need to look a long time for such numbers).


### TODO

* Optimize the algorithms to run faster
* See if some tests can be shortened and improved
